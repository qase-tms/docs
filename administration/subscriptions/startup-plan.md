To upgrade or downgrade your current plan to a Startup plan, you need to have an "Owner" or "Administrator" role in your Workspace. Or, [schedule a quick call](https://calendly.com/d/2hk-f9q-5h5/qase-upgrade-discussion) with a member of our team to confirm the correct configuration for your Workspace.
