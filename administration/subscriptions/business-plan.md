### When to choose a business plan?

The Business plan is the best starting point for teams 5+ that need extra flexibility on the user management side:

* All features from [startup plan](startup-plan.md)
* Up to 100 users per team
* 1  year of [test run data](https://help.qase.io/en/articles/10401733-what-are-data-retention-limits)
* Unlimited storage for [attachments](../workspace-management/attachments.md)
* Read-only [users](https://help.qase.io/en/articles/6417204-why-and-how-to-use-read-only-users-in-qase)
* [AI Test Case Generator](../../general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/ai-test-case-generator.md)
* [Role-based Access Control](../workspace-management/roles.md) (RBAC)
* [Test case review](../../general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/test-cases/test-case-review.md)
* [Queries](../../general/analytics/queries-qql-qase-query-language.md) (QQL, Qase Query Language)
* Premium support

There is a minimum number of 5 seats. To upgrade or downgrade your current plan to a business plan, you need to have access right "Billing" in the role.
