## How much does it cost? <a href="#h_a0d5a99c54" id="h_a0d5a99c54"></a>

Pricing is determined by _three_ key factors: _They are - the plan, billing cycle, and the number of users._

***

**1. The Plan**

You can purchase the following plans directly from your [Qase workspace](https://app.qase.io/billing) -

* [Start-up](../../subscriptions/startup-plan.md)
* [Business](../../subscriptions/business-plan.md)

If you are looking for an [Enterprise](../../subscriptions/enterprise-plan.md) subscription, please reach out to us [sales@qase.io](mailto:sales@qase.io)

***

**2. The Billing cycle**

You can choose to pay for your subscription either _monthly or annually_. The annual prices displayed on the Pricing page include a 20% discount.

***

\
**3. The User licenses**

The final cost of your subscription will depend on the _number of user licenses_ you need.

There are [two types of users](../../workspace-management/users.md): Regular and Read-only

a) Regular

| Billing \ Plan | Startup                | Business               |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Monthly        | $30 per user per month | $36 per user per month |
| Annual         | $24 per user per month | $30 per user per month |

Example: If you select the Business plan and choose to pay annually for 10 regular users, the total price would be $3,600.

Calculation: `[Price per user/per month - $30] √ó [12 months] √ó [10 users]`

b) Read-only

| Billing \ Plan | Startup                  | Business                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Monthly        | $5 per RO user per month | $3 per RO user per month |
| Annual         | $4 per RO user per month | $2 per user per month    |

Read-only users are optional, you can choose to not include them but still purchase the subscription, but for example let's say i want to add 5 read only users along with your 10 regular users on the business plan. The calcuation will be as follows:

Calculation: `[($30 + $2) per user per month] + √ó [12 months] √ó [10 users]`

***

### What am I paying for - the plan, or the users? <a href="#h_a811d71d6a" id="h_a811d71d6a"></a>

The price will depend primarily on the number of user licenses you are going to purchase. However, depending upon the plan you are going for, the price per user changes.

For example, if you have 15 users -

* Startup plan would cost you $24 per user \* 15 users = $360 per month.
* Business plan will be $36 per user \* 15 users = $540 per month.

_What's the difference between these plans? -- Find out_ [_here_](../../subscriptions/) _üîó_

### How are these licenses distributed among users? <a href="#h_772259e208" id="h_772259e208"></a>

For example, if you‚Äôve purchased 15 user licenses, you can begin inviting new users to the workspace.

When inviting users, you‚Äôll have two options:

* Invite them as Regular users.
* Invite them as Read-only users.

Users once invited, can later be converted to Regular/Read-only if required.

Let's say all of your available user licenses are distributed among your team, and you would like to add more regular users.

From the billing section, choose "Upgrade" to increase your available licenses.

<figure><img src="https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/wsaz8vex/1352984408/c912639f9b347a829f862109a7aa/98970.png?expires=1761225300&#x26;signature=cc63a3e39f9f07ebca4f92d21f1a5b4a9706fff21c8f44d60f8d2448b136dd1a&#x26;req=dSMiFMB2mYVfUfMW1HO4zfmYuhgj06m34PFHf24vPGHvPySqMmT03ibbHi9S%0AbAkRtXaCL9IvW8uP1cM%3D%0A" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<mark style="color:red;">‚ö†Ô∏è</mark> <mark style="color:$danger;">Updating the user licenses immediately charges your payment method on file. If you are paying through a credit card, funds will be charged. And, if you have opted to pay via Wire transfer, you shall receive a new invoice.</mark>

#### How much is the charge if I upgrade in the middle of my billing period? <a href="#h_6b000d4845" id="h_6b000d4845"></a>

You will be charged a pro-rated amount for the remaining period in the current billing period.

For example, if you started an annual business subscription on January 1st and added 5 more users on April 1st, the charge would be calculated as:

`(5 users) x ($30 per user) x (12 mon) x 9/12 {remaining period in the term}`

#### Okay, but what if I reduce the users mid-term? <a href="#h_2960bd359e" id="h_2960bd359e"></a>

Continuing with the same example, if you decide on July 1st that you no longer need 2 users and reduce your licenses by 2, a refund credit would be calculated as:

`(2 users) x ($30 per user) x (12 mon) x 6/12 {remaining period in the term}`

&#x20;<mark style="color:$success;">This refund will be added to your account as a credit balance.</mark>

This credit balance will be automatically applied to, either:

* your renewal payment, reducing the total amount owed by the available balance.
* or, your next user license upgrade.

#### How do I check if I am using all the available licenses?

You can check the number of Active Regular users in your workspace at any time to see how many licenses have been assigned, from the billing page -

If you'd like to find out who these users are, use the following filters on the 'Users' page:

## How do I cancel my subscription? <a href="#h_a30ebe4dc6" id="h_a30ebe4dc6"></a>

***

Subscription can be canceled from the billing page - [https://app.qase.io/billing](https://app.qase.io/billing)

By canceling the subscription, it will not auto-renew on the upcoming renewal date. The workspace will automatically transition to the Free plan at that time.

You will continue to have access to the paid features until the current subscription period ends.

<mark style="color:$warning;">‚ö†Ô∏è Before canceling, ensure that all critical project data is backed up. Evaluate the impact of the Free plan's limited features on your workflows. When the subscription transitions to the Free plan, there will be restricted access to projects, and older data, such as test runs or defect data that exceed a certain retention period, will be subject to permanent deletion in accordance with Free plan policies.</mark>
