# TMS Pricing: SSO Add-on

Qase provides Single Sign-On as an add-on with our Business tier subscriptions at an additional cost.

SSO comes as a standard feature with our Enterprise subscription, but for smaller teams of users less than 20 who still require SSO functionality, our Business plan with this add-on is an excellent fit.

The pricing follows a _per user per month_ model, with each subscription tier having specific minimum user requirements. The Business tier subscription requires a minimum of 5 users to activate. \

{% hint style="info" %}
The Business plan with SSO add-on is only available on **quarterly** and **annual** subscriptions only.
