# What are data retention Limits?

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that upgrading to a subscription will not recover test run data that is already inaccessible. The upgrade will only extend your data retention period for future runs.
{% endhint %}

### Data Accessibility by Subscription Plan <a href="#h_4214dae46b" id="h_4214dae46b"></a>

Depending on your subscription plan, there are limitations on the duration of past data that is accessible:

* Free Plan: Access to past data is limited to 30 days.
* Start-up Plan: Access to past data is limited to 90 days.
* Business Plan: Access to past data is limited to 1 year.
* Enterprise Plan: There are no restrictions; all past data remains accessible.​​

\
​**Definition of "Data"**

By data, we refer to test data such as results, defects and change log activity.​\
​

**Test Run Data**:

When data retention limitations are active on your subscription, older test run data will no longer be visible or accessible.

### Frequently Asked Questions <a href="#h_9b1316fc5f" id="h_9b1316fc5f"></a>

**Q: What happens if I downgrade from a paid subscription to the free plan?**

A: If you downgrade to the free plan, the 30-day data retention limit will immediately apply. You will lose access to test run data, defects, and change log activity older than 30 days.\
​

**Q: I briefly switched from a paid subscription to the free plan and then back to a paid plan. What happens to my test run data?**

A: When you switch to the free plan, your subscription start date is reset. As a result, only data from the past 30 days (relative to your switch date) will be retained. Switching back to a paid plan will not restore data older than 30 days.\
