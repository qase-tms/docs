# AIDEN Pricing: Explained

{% hint style="success" %}
From the [Billing page](https://app.qase.io/billing), you can view AIDEN's usage, and toggle the over-usage option.
{% endhint %}

AIDEN is **available** for all workspaces with an active subscription. To disable AIDEN completely, please [turn off](../../aiden-qase-ai/disabling-ai-features-in-your-workspace.md) the 'AI-powered workspace' toggle.

Based on your workspace plan, a quota of credits are provided.

Over usage beyond the monthly allowance is disabled by default, but you will have an option to manually enable it, from the billing page.

## Your subscription comes with Included credits <a href="#h_3ecd55fa56" id="h_3ecd55fa56"></a>

Each paid plan includes a monthly allowance of AIDEN credits. These credits do not roll over and they reset every month.

To use AIDEN, a workspace must have an active TMS subscription plan.

Depending on your current subscription plan, you shall get the following number of credits.

| Plan       | Credits (per Month) |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Startup    | 500 Credits         |
| Business   | 1000 Credits        |
| Enterprise | 2000 Credits        |

_Credits are reset monthly on the same date as your subscription start date._

| The following features require AIDEN credits: |
| --------------------------------------------- |
| Step generation attempt                       |
| A successful step generation                  |
| Code display                                  |
| Manual test case generated                    |
| Test case analysed (Test Advisor)             |

_The cost of the action may vary depending on factors such as the number of attempts, the size of the test case and other factors._

### Over usage <a href="#h_3aee8e851b" id="h_3aee8e851b"></a>

Owners and Administrators will be alerted via email when 80% and 100% of the included monthly AIDEN credits are used.

When you run out of the included AIDEN credits from your plan, you can still continue AIDEN usage by allowing over usage.

Credits used beyond the monthly allowance are billed at $0.40 per credit.

#### Limiting Over usage

When over usage is enabled, a budget can be setup to ensure AIDEN doesn't go over the specified limit.

Budget defaults to unlimited usage, but you can set a custom amount based on your needs.

Once AIDEN reaches your budget threshold and exhausts the allocated credits, the system will automatically suspend further usage to protect against overages.

### Billing <a href="#h_a2152e2017" id="h_a2152e2017"></a>

For Monthly plan: additional usage credits will be billed at the end of each billing cycle as part of the monthly invoice.

For Yearly plan: since yearly subscriptions are typically invoiced upfront, any additional AIDEN credit usage beyond the included monthly allowance will be billed separately. You'll receive an invoice each time you spend $300 using AIDEN.
