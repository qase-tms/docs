### What is TestNG?

TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language created by CÃ©dric Beust and inspired by JUnit and NUnit. The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc., with more powerful and easy-to-use functionalities.

### How to install TestNG?

To pass the results of your TestNG executions, you need to install the TestNG app.

1.  Navigate to the Apps page and switch to the "Reporters" section, then click the "TestNG" card:

3.  Switch to "Access Tokens" and generate an API token that the TestNG app will be using:

4.  Click "Guide" to access the [instruction](https://github.com/qase-tms/qase-java/tree/main/qase-testng-reporter) on adding the TestNG reporter to your automation flow:

Once the TestNG app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the TestNG as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the TestNG app as the author.
