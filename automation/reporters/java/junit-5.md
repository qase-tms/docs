### What is JUnit 5?

JUnit 5 is an open source framework, which is used for writing and running tests. Provides annotations to identify test methods. Provides assertions for testing expected results. Provides test runners for running tests.

### How to install JUnit 5?

1.  Navigate to the[ Apps page](https://app.qase.io/apps) and switch to "Reporters" section, then click the "JUnit 5" card:

Once the JUnit 5 app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the JUnit 5 as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the JUnit 5 app as the author.
