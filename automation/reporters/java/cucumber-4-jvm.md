### What is Cucumber 4 (jvm)?

Cucumber 4 (jvm) is a pure Java implementation of Cucumber. You can run it with the tool of your choice. Cucumber 4 (jvm) also integrates with all popular dependency injection containers. For more information on running Cucumber, see the [official documentation](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#running-cucumber). To learn more about integrating Cucumber with dependency injection containers, refer to [this guide](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/java/#dependency-injection).

3.  Switch to "Access Tokens" and generate an API token that the Cucumber 4 (jvm) app will be using:

4.  Click "Guide" to access the [instruction](https://github.com/qase-tms/qase-java/tree/main/qase-cucumber-v4-reporter) on adding the Cucumber 4 (jvm) reporter to your automation flow:

Once the Cucumber 4 (jvm) app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the Cucumber 4 (jvm) as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the Cucumber 4 (jvm) app as the author.
