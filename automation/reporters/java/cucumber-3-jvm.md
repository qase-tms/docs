Once the Cucumber 3 (jvm) app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the Cucumber 3 (jvm) as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the Cucumber 3 (jvm) app as the author.
