### What is Cucumber 3 (jvm)?

Cucumber 3 (jvm) is a pure Java implementation of Cucumber. You can [run](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/#running-cucumber) it with the tool of your choice. Cucumber 3 (jvm) also integrates with all the popular [Dependency Injection containers](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/java/#dependency-injection).

### How to install Cucumber 3 (jvm)?

1.  Navigate to the[ Apps page](https://app.qase.io/apps) and switch to the "Reporters" section, then click the "Cucumber-JVM" card:

Once the Cucumber 3 (jvm) app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the Cucumber 3 (jvm) as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the Cucumber 3 (jvm) app as the author.
