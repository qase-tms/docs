### What is Kaspresso?

Kaspresso is a powerful Android UI testing framework built on top of Espresso and UIAutomator, designed to simplify and enhance test automation. It provides improved readability, stability, and maintainability of tests by offering clear structure, reusable test steps, and advanced logging capabilities.&#x20;

Kaspresso supports complex test scenarios, integrates with tools like Kakao for Kotlin DSL-based testing, and allows for customization to handle flaky tests efficiently.&#x20;
