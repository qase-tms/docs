### What is Mocha?

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and in the browser, making asynchronous testing _simple_ and _fun_. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.

### How to install Mocha?

To pass the results of your Mocha executions, you need to install the Mocha app.

1. Navigate to the[ Apps page](https://app.qase.io/apps) and switch to the "Reporters" section, then click the "Mocha" card:
2. Click "Activate":
3. Switch to "Access Tokens" and generate an API token that the Mocha app will be using:
4.  Click "Guide" to access the [instruction](https://github.com/qase-tms/qase-javascript/tree/main/qase-mocha) on adding the Mocha reporter to your automation flow:



Once the Mocha app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the Mocha as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the Mocha app as the author.
