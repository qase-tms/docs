### What is WebDriverIO?

WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite.

### How to install WebDriverIO?

To pass the results of your WebDriverIO executions, you need to install the WebDriverIO app.

1. Navigate to the[ Apps page](https://app.qase.io/apps) and switch to the "Reporters" section, then click the "WebDriverIO " card:
2. Click "Activate":
3. Switch to "Access Tokens" and generate an API token that the WebDriverIO app will be using:
4.  Click "Guide" to access the [instruction](https://github.com/qase-tms/qase-javascript/tree/main/qase-wdio) on adding the WebDriverIO reporter to your automation flow:



Once the WebDriverIO app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the WebDriverIO as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the WebDriverIO app as the author.
