### What is Tavern?

Tavern is a pytest plugin, command-line tool and Python library for automated testing of APIs, with a simple, concise and flexible YAML-based syntax. It's very simple to get started, and highly customisable for complex tests. Tavern supports testing RESTful APIs as well as MQTT based APIs.

### Get an API token for the reporter:

To pass the results of your Tavern executions, let's first get an API Token:

1. Get an API token from this page: [https://app.qase.io/user/api/token](https://app.qase.io/user/api/token)
2. Find the [instructions](https://github.com/qase-tms/qase-python/tree/main/qase-tavern) to adding the Behave reporter to your automation flow.
