### What is Robot Framework?

Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development. It is a keyword-driven testing framework that uses tabular test data syntax.

To pass the results of your Robot Framework executions, you need to install the Robot Framework app.

Once the Robot Framework app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the Robot Framework as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the Robot Framework app as the author.
