### What is Pytest?

Pytest is a Python testing framework that originated from the PyPy project. It can be used to write various types of software tests, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and functional tests. Its features include parametrized testing, fixtures, and assert re-writing.

### How to install Pytest?

To pass the results of your Pytest executions, you need to install the Pytest app.

1.  Navigate to the[ Apps page](https://app.qase.io/apps) and switch to "Reporters" section, then click the "Pytest" card:\

3.  Switch to "Access Tokens" and generate an API token that the Pytest app will be using:

Once the Pytest app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the Pytest as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the Pytest app as the author.
