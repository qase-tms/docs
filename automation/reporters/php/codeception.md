### What is Codeception?

Codeception is a framework used for creating tests, including unit tests, functional tests, and acceptance tests. Despite the fact that it is based on PHP, the user needs only basic knowledge for starting work with the framework. Inspired by BDD, it provides an absolutely new way of writing acceptance, functional and even unit tests.

### How to install Codeception?

To pass the results of your Codeception executions, you need to install the Codeception app.

1.  Navigate to the[ Apps page](https://app.qase.io/apps) and switch to "Reporters" section, then click the "Codeception" card:

3.  Switch to "Access Tokens" and generate an API token that the Codeception app will be using:

Once the Codeception app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the Codeception as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the Codeception app as the author.
