### What is PHPUnit?

PHPUnit is a unit testing framework for the PHP programming language. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks that originated with SUnit and became popular with JUnit. PHPUnit was created by Sebastian Bergmann and its development is hosted on GitHub.

### How ti install PHPUnit?

To pass the results of your PHPUnit executions, you need to install the PHPUnit app.

1.  Navigate to the[ Apps page](https://app.qase.io/apps) and switch to the "Reporters" section, then click the "PHPUnit" card:

3.  Switch to "Access Tokens" and generate an API token that the PHPUnit app will be using:

Once the PHPUnit app is installed, any test cases, test runs, and test results created and submitted will appear with the PHPUnit as the author of said cases, runs or results (instead of a specific user whose API token has been used). Slack notifications will also appear with the PHPUnit app as the author.
