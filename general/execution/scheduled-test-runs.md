# Schedule Test runs

It's useful to have a new test run automatically created ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs a regular regression check, or something that needs to run every week or before a release.

You can schedule test runs so they happen automatically at the time you choose. Both [Manual](../get-started-with-the-qase-platform/create-a-test-run/) and [Cloud test runs](../../aiden/aiden-qa-architect.md#h_8203030372) can be automatically created at the chosen time and intervals.

You can create a scheduled test run either from the Test runs section, or from the test repository by selecting the cases directly.

You can select the start date, time and the interval (how often the run is repeated).

At the selected time, you will see a new test run in the '**Run execution**' tab.

The scheduled test runs are identified with a 'üîÅ' symbol.

All of the runs you have scheduled can be viewed from this dedicated tab.

Select any date to view the test runs scheduled for that day. Dates with scheduled runs are marked with a small dot for easy identification.

After selecting a date, you can view the scheduled runs. From there, you have the option to edit the run‚Äôs configuration, such as the title, description, and test cases, or delete the schedule entirely.

**Please note**: the scheduled frequency cannot be modified after the run is created. To change it, you‚Äôll need to delete the existing schedule and create a new one with the desired frequency.
